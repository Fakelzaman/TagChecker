Input:
String of text

Output:
Success: "Correctly tagged paragraph"
Failed: "Expected <expected> found <unexpected>"

Conditions:
- Check all tags that open have a closing tag
- Check all closing tags have an opening tag


Definitions:
- Tag is a pattern of text that matches a single capital letter inside angle brackets  (<T>)
- A closing tag is a tag with a single capital letter with inside angle brackets with a forward slash prior to the letter (</T>)

Assumptions:
- A paragraph does not have to contain any tags
- Tags contain ONLY 1 letter. ie maximum of 24 tag types
- The program only needs to be command line compatible. ie node script
- No authentication is needed
- No external calls are needed to be made
- Can run offline
- Child tags cannot be closed outside the parent Tag


Approach
- match all cases of patterns to an array
- iterate over the array looking, if opener shift to a queue to check
- if next in array is an open add to queue and look for that one
- if next in array is the closing, remove and carry on
- if next in array is wrong closing, throw error
- if both arrays are empty success
- if initial array has item expecting a blank
- if queue array has item missing a closing
